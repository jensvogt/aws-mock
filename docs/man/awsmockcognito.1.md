## NAME
```awsmockcognito``` AwsMock Cognito module

## DESCRIPTION
Cognito is a managed identity service provided by AWS that is used for securing user authentication, authorization, and 
managing user identities in web and mobile applications. Cognito enables developers to add user sign-up, sign-in, and 
access control functionalities to their applications. Cognito supports various authentication methods, including social 
identity providers, SAML-based identity providers, and custom authentication flows.

AwsMock supports Cognito, allowing you to use the Cognito APIs in your local environment to manage authentication and 
access control for your local application and resources. The supported APIs are available on our Cognito Identity 
coverage page and Cognito User Pools coverage page, which provides information on the extent of Cognitoâ€™s integration 
with AwsMock.

The Cognito module can be configured using the ```awslocal``` command. For details of the ```awslocal``` command see the 
corresponding man page ```awslocal(1)```.

```awslocal cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name <user-pool-name>```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creates a new Cognito user pool.
