## NAME
```awsmocktransfer``` AwsMock Transfer Server module

## DESCRIPTION
The AWS Transfer API is a powerful tool that empowers users to establish FTP(S) servers with ease. These servers serve 
as gateways, allowing direct access to files residing in Amazon S3 buckets. This functionality streamlines file 
management processes, making it simpler and more efficient to handle data stored in S3 by providing a familiar FTP 
interface for users to interact with their files securely. Whether youâ€™re looking to facilitate file transfers or 
enhance your data access capabilities, the AWS Transfer API simplifies the process and extends the versatility of 
your cloud storage infrastructure.

The SQS module can be configured using the ```awslocal``` command. For details of the ```awslocal``` command see the 
corresponding man page ```awslocal(1)```.

## COMMANDS

```awslocal transfer create-server --protocols <protocols>```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creates a new transfer server

```awslocal transfer list-servers```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lists all available transfer servers

```awslocal transfer delete-server --server-url <server-id>```  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deletes a transfer server

## EXAMPLES

To create a new transfer server:
```
awslocal transfer create-server --protocols ftp
{
    "ServerId": "s-27134679b31c0a9833ee"
}
```

To get a list of all currently available transfer servers:
```
awslocal transfer list-servers
{
